ok i want to keep working on this but i feel like i should just note down my thoughts for when thomas is next online
so we can talk abbout together

basically what's going on with the formations?

my current idea is that when you select 5 ships in a line, and give them an order, a new object will be created
to contain them, along with a navigationAgent2d

then it keeps track of the botes in relation to each other, and makes sure when navigating coastline that all of them
avoid it by having it's radius for the navigationAgent include all of the ships from its origin

although maybe moving the whole object would get weird. perhaps a node that doesn't contain the botes but
constantly updates its position to be the average position of the botes


should the player be able to dictate which way the botes should face when they reach their position?
how should this be implemented? how should the player input this command?


if the player wants to take control of a single bote, what input should do this? should a player be
able to manually control two botes with the keyboard at once?


capital ship in formation is marked at a leader of the formation and has its own navigation agent
that sets the course for the whole formation
other ships have navigation agents just trying to reach a certain position relative to this capital ship
